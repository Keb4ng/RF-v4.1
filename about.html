                workflow and transform business processes. Once a functionality
                gap or a workflow inefficiency has been identified, we leverage
                Salesforce as a low code platform to develop customer specific
                solutions, with modules like Publicity or Advertising, which can
                then be adapted by our other customers. In addition, we also
                work to implement standard Salesforce CRM, Case Management,
                Marketing Cloud modules and integrate them with the existing
                technology architecture.
